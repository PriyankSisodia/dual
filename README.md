# DUAL - Social Debate Web App

A responsive web application that breaks echo chambers by displaying every post as a split-screen narrative. Each "Dual-Card" consists of a Left Side and a Right Side, representing two opposing or different opinions on the same topic.

## Features

- **Split-UI**: 50/50 vertical layout for every post
- **Half-Post Loop**: Users can create a "Left Side" post that stays in "Pending" state until another user completes the "Right Side"
- **Leaning Bar**: Visual slider showing which side is winning based on community votes
- **Changed My Mind**: Button that rewards authors with "Persuasion Points" when users change their stance
- **Snackable Content**: Max 400 characters per side to maintain high engagement
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
